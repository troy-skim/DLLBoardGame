## Board Game Rules

- Players start at "Start" and roll a dice (1-6).  <br />
- Move forward the rolled number of colored blocks.  <br />
- If the square is empty, add its number to the player's score.  <br />
- If occupied, move the previous player back 7 spaces and add square's number to current player's score.  <br />
- A player moving back 7 and sharing a block has no effect.  <br />
- Going back past the 1st square puts player at "Start."  <br />
- Game ends if player reaches or exceeds "End" with â‰¥44 points or goes back to "Start" otherwise.  <br />
- Simulate 1000 games with Player A, record average winning moves.  <br />
- Repeat simulation with Player A and B up to 4 players, display results.  <br />
