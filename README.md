## Board Game Rules

Players start at "Start" and roll a dice (1-6).
Move forward the rolled number of colored blocks.
If the square is empty, add its number to the player's score.
If occupied, move the previous player back 7 spaces and add square's number to current player's score.
A player moving back 7 and sharing a block has no effect.
Going back past the 1st square puts player at "Start."
Game ends if player reaches or exceeds "End" with â‰¥44 points or goes back to "Start" otherwise.
Simulate 1000 games with Player A, record average winning moves.
Repeat simulation with Player A and B up to 4 players, display results.

Board: Start, 5, 10, 8, 10, 7, 5, 9, 10, 6, 7, 10, 6, 5, 8, 9, 5, 10, 5, 9, 6, 8, 7, 10, 6, 8, End
